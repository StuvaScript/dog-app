# Dog App

Do you love sweet doggoes? We do too! With our Dog App, you can search for your favorite pup and find out a little bit more info about the breed!

## Where To Find It

Visit the [live project here](https://stuvascript.github.io/dog-app/).

## How To Use It

### Search

Simply type in whatever breed you like in the search bar and hit the `Enter` key or click the 'search icon'. A list of breeds will pop up. Click the breed image to find out further info about that breed. Enjoy the gif of a dog running while you wait for the info to load!

### Navigating back

Click the 'back button' on the screen to return to the previous page or click the logo at the top of the page to return to the main menu.

## Editing The Code

To work with this code:

1. Find the file called ".env_sample"
2. Create a file called ".env" on the same file hierarchal level as ".env_sample"
3. Copy the ".env_sample" file contents to ".env"
4. In the ".env" file, replace the "API_KEY" value with your personal API key
5. Type the console command `npm run start`. Run this command every time you modify this file. If it can't find Webpack:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Type `npx webpack --watch`. Answer "yes" to any questions that pop up. This will install Webpack.</li>
    <li>When it's finished, type `npm run start` again.</li>
    <li>Then type `npx webpack --watch` again.</li>
</ol>
